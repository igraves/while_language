Haskell Implementation of a While Language

Overview

This Haskell package is a basic implementation of a while language
for experimentation with compilation, interpretation, and formal methods.

The current package includes a front end parser written in parsec, an basic
abstract syntax and a pure interpreter that runs the abstract syntax.
